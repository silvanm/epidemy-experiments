# epidemy-experiments

This app allows us to simulate the spread of an infection like the
Corona-Virus. Each dot represents a person. If the dot is gray, then the
person is not infected yet. Once the person touches an infected person, it
gets affected as well.

Credits go to [this excellent article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/) 
in the Washington Post which influenced me heavily.
